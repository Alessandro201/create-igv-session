Available styles:

- default
    Create a session with the bigWig tracks of every sample, the merged bigWig of every histone mark, and the corresponding consensus peaks called on the merged file.

    You need to give the paths to the above mentioned files, example:
    create-igv-session                                                  \
        H3K*/1_cutandrun/results/03_peak_calling/03_bed_to_bigwig/      \
        CONSENSUS                                                       \
        -p default


- default-rna
    Same as above but with the RNA tracks:

    create-igv-session                                                  \
        H3K*/1_cutandrun/results/03_peak_calling/03_bed_to_bigwig/      \
        CONSENSUS                                                       \
        RNASEQ/results/star_salmon/bigwig/                              \
        -p default-rna


- default-overlay-rna
    Same as above but with the RNA tracks overlayed:

    create-igv-session                                                  \
        H3K*/1_cutandrun/results/03_peak_calling/03_bed_to_bigwig/      \
        CONSENSUS                                                       \
        RNASEQ/results/star_salmon/bigwig/                              \
        -p default-overlay-rna


- final-rna
    Create an IGV session with the consensus peaks, the corresponding merged bigWig tracks, and the rna tracks.

    create-igv-session                                                  \
        CONSENSUS                                                       \
        RNASEQ/results/star_salmon/bigwig/                              \
        -p final-rna
